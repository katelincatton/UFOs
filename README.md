Overview

The purpose is to build a successful webpage via JavaScript, HTML, and CSS styling. The webpage was built up from scratch, meaning that we created the title, background image, body, table, and more with the help of html. The data examines possible UFO sightings, which contain variables such as date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and additional comments for each sighting. With these variables, the UFO sightings are well-defined. However, to dive deeper, we have created filter options for the table to narrow down the data.

After successfully building the webpage, you may be wondering how to utilized the webpage to your best ability. With the ability to filter on Data, City, State, Country, and Shape... the possibilities are endless when examining UFO sightings. For example, below we have shown how to filter on a specific date: 1/1/2010. You simply type the date “1/1/2010’ into the Date filter box and press Enter. This will them populate the new table only containing data that falls under the criteria. This process can be followed the same way for the filters City, State, Country, and Shape.

Summary
---
This webpage is great for a simple view of the data, however, even with the availability of filters, it’s hard to manipulate and draw conclusions from the data. This is the biggest drawback because it makes it harder for data analysis. For example, within excel, you can filter, sort, count, and run additional analysis on the data, whereas you cannot do that with this webpage (except filter). There are two recommendations to improve this webpage for future development below:
1. Add an export option, such as Excel, that way the viewer has the option to drill down further if needed.
2. Within the webpage, I would suggest allowing for the Data filter to accept data intervals instead of a singular date. For example, instead of searching for “1/10/2010” specially, you would be able to search the UFO sightings that entire week from “1/10/2010 to 1/7/2010”. This allows for a flexible filter option for the viewer.
